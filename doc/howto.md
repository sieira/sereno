# How am I suppossed to use sereno
Sereno will not make any authentication, login or session stuff. It will delegate in another strategy for that purpose.
sereno is designed as a Strategy factory.

## Todo
 - [ ] Allow to change the strategy name, so several instances can be registered for an authentication chain.
  - This will mean that several authentication methods lead to several encryption keys, and this will be postponed until I come with a goo idea about how to do it

## Example
We start by getting our strategy

    LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;

Then, our strategy will be generated by requiring sereno, and giving a Strategy to the factory method.

    var SerenoStrategy = require('sereno').init(LocalStrategy);
