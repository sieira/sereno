# How am I supposed to use sereno
Sereno will not make any authentication, login or session stuff. It will delegate in another strategy for that purpose.
sereno is designed as a Strategy factory.

Currently (0.0.2), sereno does only support a sessionless LocalStrategy, and can only encrypt/decrypt data when sending the user's credentials as part of the requests

## Todo
 - [ ] Allow to change the strategy name, so several instances can be registered for an authentication chain.
  - This will mean that several authentication methods lead to several encryption keys, and this will be postponed until I come with a goo idea about how to do it

## Example
We start by getting our strategy

    LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;

Then, our strategy will be generated by requiring sereno, and giving a Strategy to the factory method.

    var SerenoStrategy = require('sereno').init(LocalStrategy),
        serenoLocalStrategy = new SerenoStrategy(
           function (username, password, done) {
             User.findOne({ username: username }, function(err, user) {
               if (err) { return done(err); }
               if (!user) {
                 return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username.' });
               }
               if (!user.password === password) {
                 return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect password.' });
               }
               return done(null, user);
             });
           }
        );

Note that this local strategy depends on a mongoose model (User) that you will have to implement.

Finally, you can use this strategy with passport like this :

    passport.use(serenoLocalStrategy);

From then on, sereno will be available for authentication on routing:

    app.post('/encrypt', passport.authenticate('sereno'), serenoLocalStrategy.encrypt);
